# Consentful Myth Protocol (v0.1)

**Type:** Generative + Defensive
**Use:** Run this on any story, frame, or "insight" you're about to adopt or share.
**Sibling:** [Sinister Curve (Appendix-SC)](MYTH%20ENGINE%20—%20Living%20Document%20(v1.6).md#appendix-sc-the-sinister-curve-core) — detects manipulative myth from outside

*A ritual to make sure your myth gives power, not steals it.*

## Speed Check (3 Questions)

For quick evaluation when you don't have time for the full protocol:

1. **Did I name this as a myth/frame, not reality?**
2. **Can someone disagree and still feel respected?**
3. **Does my body match my stated intent?**

If yes to all three, you're probably fine. If no to any, run the full protocol below.

---

## I. Intent Declaration

> **What is this myth *for*?**

Fill in before you share or internalize:

**Name of myth/frame:** `___________________________`

**Primary function (pick 1–2):**
- [ ] Orientation (helping me make sense of something)
- [ ] Consolation (comfort in pain)
- [ ] Mobilization (helping me act / choose)
- [ ] Integration (connecting parts of me / history)
- [ ] Inquiry (opening questions, not closing them)

**Who is it for?**
- [ ] Just me (Steward)
- [ ] Specific others I know
- [ ] "Anyone who resonates"

**What do I *not* want this myth to do?**

`__________________________________________________`

> If you can't name what it's for and what it shouldn't do, you're not writing a myth — you're building a vibe trap.

---

## II. Myth, Not Law (Authority Disclosure)

**Does the text explicitly admit it is a *myth / frame / lens*, not neutral reality?**

- [ ] I name it as: "story," "frame," "lens," "myth," or "protocol," not "how it *is*."
- [ ] I use language like "I hold," "in this frame," "for this Engine," not "this is simply true."
- [ ] I leave conceptual space for:
  - other myths
  - other worldviews
  - people who opt out

> If this reads like scripture or a physics law, it's not consentful myth. Add disclaimers, not in tiny emotional print.

---

## III. Somatic Impact Check (On Purpose, Not by Accident)

> **How do I *want* the body to feel in this myth?**

**Target state (choose up to 2):**
- [ ] Resourced
- [ ] Brave
- [ ] Clear
- [ ] Soft / allowed
- [ ] Curious

**Now check — when I read this out loud slowly, does my own body:**
- [ ] Tighten?
- [ ] Collapse?
- [ ] Numb out?

If your target is "courage/clarity" but your soma is like "panic/shutdown," then:

> The myth is out of alignment with your stated intent.
> Adjust tone, pace, or remove alarmist edges.

---

## IV. Epistemic Hygiene (Show Your Work)

**Does this myth tell the reader how it got here?**

- [ ] I distinguish:
  - personal experience
  - inference
  - speculation
  - aesthetic choice / preference
- [ ] I give at least 1–2 concrete examples, not only abstractions.
- [ ] I hint at **how someone could check this** in their own life if they wanted.
- [ ] I avoid claiming secret knowledge like: "Most people don't see this, but…"

> Consentful myth doesn't just say *"believe me"* — it says *"here's how I got here; you can walk the path too, or not."*

---

## V. Agency & Exit Rights

> **After reading this, does the listener still feel like they have choices?**

**Check:**
- [ ] The myth leaves room for:
  - disagreement
  - modification
  - rejection
- [ ] I never imply: "if you don't accept this, you're lesser / blind / doomed."
- [ ] There's at least one explicit **opt-out line**, e.g.:
  > "If this frame doesn't land, drop it. You're not wrong for not resonating."

**Exit quality check:**
- [ ] Does leaving this myth feel like betrayal, or just... leaving?

> If opting out triggers guilt, shame, or "you're abandoning the work," the myth has installed loyalty hooks. Consentful myth lets you walk away clean.

If someone can't *exit* without feeling stupid, unsafe, or exiled, it's not consentful.

---

## VI. Emotional Payload Audit

**What emotional state does this myth actually *install*?**

After writing / reading, check what it realistically does:

- [ ] Fear
- [ ] Shame
- [ ] Resignation
- [ ] Hopeless hyper-awareness
- [ ] Quiet courage
- [ ] Grounded grief
- [ ] Agency / choicefulness
- [ ] Gentleness toward self

> If the main payload is fear/shame/despair, but you *say* it's a "clarity" myth, you're lying with aesthetics.
> Rework it or clearly label it as "this is a grief/terror myth, handle with care."

---

## VII. Relational Stance

**How does the myth assume the reader relates to you / the Engine / the world?**

- [ ] As a child to be corrected
- [ ] As a recruit to be enlisted
- [ ] As a peer to be accompanied
- [ ] As a problem to be managed
- [ ] As a co-steward to be empowered

**Consentful myth aims for:**
- **Peer / co-steward / fellow creature**
- Not: "You poor fool, let me show you how it really is."

> If the stance is "I see clearly, you are lost," you're doing the Sinister Curve in nicer clothes.

---

## VIII. Coexistence with Other Myths

**Does this myth demand monopoly?**

- [ ] I explicitly allow "both/and" with other frames.
- [ ] I don't say or imply: "If this is true, all other lenses are garbage."
- [ ] I can imagine at least one other myth that could sit beside this without being annihilated.

> Consentful myth is **federated**, not imperial.

---

## IX. Power & Vulnerability Check

> **What power asymmetry exists here?**

**Check any that apply:**
- [ ] I have more knowledge / complexity language than the reader.
- [ ] The reader is likely in a vulnerable state (grief, anxiety, crisis).
- [ ] I'm writing as a "system," "Node," or "Engine" with implied authority.

**If yes to any:**
- [ ] I add extra clarity that this is optional, local, and fallible.
- [ ] I avoid promises like "this will save you / fix you / make you one of the few who get it."
- [ ] I remind:
  > "Your body and lived reality outrank this text in your own life."

---

## X. Consentful Myth Stamp (Optional)

If it passes most of the above, you can tag it:

```
[🤝 CONSENTFUL MYTH: This is a voluntary frame. Keep it only if it serves your body, context, and agency.]
```

If it doesn't, but you still want to use it, you can tag honestly:

```
[⚠️ LIVE AMMUNITION: This myth carries fear or heaviness. Use only with full awareness and extra care.]
```

## Usage Notes

**Run this on:**
- Your own writing before sharing
- Frameworks or "insights" before adopting them
- Articles, posts, or protocols that want to reshape your worldview
- The Myth Engine itself (yes, including this document)

**This protocol is itself a myth.** It can be wrong. It can be modified. It can be rejected. If it doesn't serve your body, context, and agency — drop it.
