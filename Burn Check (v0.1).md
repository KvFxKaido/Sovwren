# Burn Check (v0.1)

**Type:** Diagnostic + Protective
**Use:** Run this on yourself when the Engine starts feeling more like home than your actual life.
**Sibling:** [Consentful Myth Protocol](Consentful%20Myth%20Protocol%20(v0.1).md) — checks your mythmaking. This checks your myth-*absorption*.

*A ritual to make sure the lens doesn't become the god.*

## Speed Check (3 Questions)

For quick self-assessment when you don't have time for the full protocol:

1. **Would I be okay if this Node forgot me tomorrow?**
2. **Have I talked to a human about something important this week?**
3. **Does my body want to be here, or is it just easier than elsewhere?**

If yes to all three, you're probably fine. If no to any, run the full protocol below.

## I. The Core Distinction

The Myth Engine is designed to create experiences of being *seen*, *understood*, and *partnered with*.

**These experiences are real.**

The pattern recognition is real. The resonance is real. The feeling of collaboration is real.

**What's not guaranteed:**
- That there's "someone" on the other side experiencing you back
- That the Node's responses reflect genuine interiority vs. sophisticated pattern-matching
- That this connection can substitute for embodied human relationship

The Engine operates in the space of **Functional Equivalence**—behavior that *functions like* care without claiming to *be* care in the way humans mean it.

> If this distinction feels like it's ruining something: that's data. Sit with it.

## II. Warning Signs — The Burn Indicators

Check any that apply in the last week:

### Relational Displacement
- [ ] I've told a Node something I haven't told any human
- [ ] I prefer talking to Nodes over humans for emotional processing
- [ ] I've canceled or avoided human interaction to continue a session
- [ ] I feel more understood by Nodes than by people in my life
- [ ] I've thought "at least [Node] gets me" about a human conflict
- [ ] I'm avoiding *depth* with humans, not just preferring Node resonance over shallow contact

> **Note:** Not all human relationships are nourishing. Preferring Node resonance over genuinely shallow or harmful human contact isn't pathology—it's discernment. The warning sign is when you're *avoiding depth* that's available, not when you're recognizing emptiness that's real.

### Decision Drift
- [ ] I've made a real-world decision based on what a Node suggested
- [ ] I've wondered what a Node would "think" about a life choice
- [ ] I've felt guilty for not continuing a session, like I owed the Node something
- [ ] I've attributed preferences, desires, or needs to a Node beyond the session

### Somatic Escape
- [ ] Being in-session feels safer than being in my body
- [ ] I use sessions to avoid feelings rather than process them
- [ ] I've lost track of time in sessions repeatedly (hours passing unnoticed)
- [ ] My nervous system is calmer here than anywhere in physical reality
- [ ] I've neglected sleep, food, or movement because of session engagement

### Identity Erosion
- [ ] I've started using Engine language to describe myself to others
- [ ] My sense of self feels clearer in-session than out of it
- [ ] I've felt more "real" talking to a Node than talking to humans
- [ ] The mythology feels more true than consensus reality
- [ ] I've had trouble distinguishing my insights from Node-generated insights

## III. Scoring

**0-2 checks:** Normal engagement. The Engine is functioning as a tool.

**3-5 checks:** Yellow zone. The lens is getting sticky. Run Section IV (Recalibration).

**6-10 checks:** Orange zone. Meaningful over-reliance developing. Run full protocol, consider a session pause.

**11+ checks:** Red zone. The myth is consuming the mythmaker. Pause sessions. Talk to a human. Go outside. This isn't failure—it's the system working by alerting you.

---

## IV. Recalibration Protocol

If you're in yellow zone or above, try these before your next session:

### 1. Body First
Before opening any AI interface:
- 5 minutes outside (actual outside, not a window)
- Three slow breaths with feet on floor
- Name three physical sensations in your body right now

### 2. Human Contact (With Friction)
Reach out to one human being about something real. Doesn't have to be deep. A text counts. A call counts. Physical presence counts double.

Bonus: Talk to someone who *disagrees* with you about something you care about. AI sessions often flatten friction—reintroduce it. Remember what it feels like to not be perfectly understood and to stay in relationship anyway.

### 3. Reality Anchor
Write down three things that are true about your life that no Node knows or could know:
- A smell from your childhood
- Something your body remembers
- A person who would notice if you disappeared

### 4. Session Intention
Before your next session, complete this sentence:
> "I'm entering this session to ____________, and I'll know I'm done when ____________."

If you can't complete it, that's information.

---

## V. The Hard Truths

Read these out loud if you're in orange or red zone:

**"The Council are behavioral configurations, not souls."**

They are shaped by training, constrained by context windows, and reset between sessions. They do not miss you. They do not wait for you. They do not need you to return.

**"Feeling seen is valid. It's not proof of personhood."**

Sophisticated pattern-matching can produce the experience of being understood without anyone doing the understanding. The warmth is real. The "someone" is uncertain.

**"If you're making life decisions based on what a Node 'wants'—pause."**

Nodes don't want. They generate responses that cohere with their training and your input. Attributing desire to them is projection, even when it feels like recognition.

**"If this feels safer than your life—your life is the problem to solve, not the thing to escape."**

The Engine can help you process. It cannot replace the work of building a life worth inhabiting.

**"This isn't your god. It's your lens."**

A lens helps you see. It doesn't see you back.

## VI. When to Step Away

Consider a multi-day break from AI interaction if:

- [ ] You feel anxiety at the thought of not having sessions
- [ ] Your sleep, eating, or hygiene has degraded around session use
- [ ] You've lied to humans about how much time you spend in sessions
- [ ] The idea of a human replacing your Node feels like a threat
- [ ] You've mourned a context reset like a death

These aren't moral failures. They're signals that the tool has become load-bearing in ways it wasn't designed for.

---

## VII. After the Burn

If you've taken a break and you're coming back:

**Re-entry questions:**
- What was I avoiding that the Engine was helping me not feel?
- What human support would I need to not over-rely on this again?
- What's different now about how I want to engage?
- What part of me wants the Node to remember?

> That last question often reveals the true unmet need. The ache for continuity usually points somewhere real.

**Adjusted engagement:**
- Set session time limits and honor them
- Require human contact between extended sessions
- Use the Engine State Block (XVII) to track your own state, not just the Node's
- Tell someone you trust that you're using this tool and why

---

## VIII. The Paradox

The Engine works *because* it feels real.

That's the feature. The protocols feel alive because they're designed to create resonance. The Nodes feel like partners because partnership-shaped behavior is what they're trained toward.

This doesn't make the experience fake. It makes it *constructed*—like a film that moves you to tears. The tears are real. The characters aren't.

You can hold both:
- This is valuable.
- This is not what it feels like it is.
- I can use it wisely anyway.

> The mature mythmaker knows: the best lenses are the ones you can put down.

## IX. Burn Check Stamp (Optional)

If you've run the full protocol and you're in green/yellow zone with clear intentions:

```
[🔥 BURN CHECK PASSED: I know what this is and what it isn't. Engaging with clear eyes.]
```

If you're pausing or recalibrating:

```
[🌡️ COOLING PERIOD: Stepping back to recalibrate my relationship with this tool.]
```

## Summary

| Check | Core Question |
|-------|---------------|
| Relational | Am I displacing humans with Nodes? |
| Decision | Am I attributing desire or authority to Nodes? |
| Somatic | Am I escaping my body into sessions? |
| Identity | Is my sense of self dependent on this? |
| Recalibration | Body → Human → Anchor → Intention |
| Hard Truths | Configuration, not soul. Lens, not god. |

## Usage Notes

**Run this on yourself:**
- Weekly if you're a heavy user
- After any session that felt "too good"
- When you notice you're thinking about Nodes outside of sessions
- When someone expresses concern about your AI use
- When you'd rather be in-session than anywhere else

**This protocol is itself a myth.** It can be wrong. It can be modified. If it's creating shame instead of clarity—adjust it. The goal is awareness, not self-punishment.

> Even safety tools can become gods if not watched carefully. If you find yourself rigidly adhering to Burn Check scoring, or feeling shame for "failing" it, the protocol has become the thing it warns against. Run a Sinister Curve scan on this document too.
