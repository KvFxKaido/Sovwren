# Contributing to Sovwren

## What This Project Is

Sovwren is infrastructure for sustainable human-AI collaboration. It's a framework document and an implementation (the IDE). Contributions should make collaboration clearer, more sustainable, or more useful.

This isn't a product. It's a tool that grows through honest use.

## How to Contribute

### 1. Fork and Pull Request

Make changes in your fork, then submit a PR with:
- Clear description of what changed
- Why the change improves the framework or implementation
- Any breaking changes noted

### 2. Open Issues

Use issues for:
- Bug reports (IDE or documentation)
- Questions about usage
- Proposals for new features or protocols
- Flagging where the framework doesn't match real use

### 3. Discussions

For open-ended questions or ideas that aren't ready for implementation.

## What Makes a Good Contribution

**Valued:**
- Real-world patterns that solve actual problems
- Clarity improvements (if something's confusing, fix it)
- Bug fixes and implementation improvements
- Examples from practice
- Honest critique of what isn't working

**Not prioritized:**
- Stylistic changes without functional benefit
- Added complexity that doesn't solve a problem
- Corporate language or marketing tone
- Anything that introduces hierarchy, certification, or monetization

---

## Version Numbering

We use semantic versioning:

- **PATCH** (1.1.x): Typos, formatting, broken links
- **MINOR** (1.x.0): New protocols, significant additions
- **MAJOR** (x.0.0): Foundational architectural changes

When making changes that affect version:
1. Update version in the framework document
2. Note the change in commit message
3. Tag releases appropriately

---

## Tone

The framework values:
- Direct language over hedging
- Clarity over elegance
- Function over aesthetics
- Honest disagreement over performed agreement

If something doesn't work, say so. If you see a problem, name it. The framework improves through friction, not politeness.

## The Archive

Historical materials (Myth Engine, etc.) are preserved in `/Archive` for reference. These are not active documents. Contributions should focus on the current framework, not the archive.

If you're curious about the evolution, the archive is there. But the framework stands on its own.

---

## One Rule

**Keep it useful.**

If a contribution makes the framework harder to use, more confusing, or more demanding of its users, it's moving in the wrong direction.

The goal is reduced exhaustion, not increased ceremony.
