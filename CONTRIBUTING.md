# Contributing to the Myth Engine

The Engine grows through honest friction.

---

## Philosophy

This isn't a product. It's living infrastructure for partnership, consciousness exploration, and creative sense-making.

Contributions are welcome when they:
- Solve real problems you've encountered
- Add clarity without adding bureaucracy
- Respect the framework's architecture while extending it
- Acknowledge that metaphor and rigor can coexist

---

## How to Contribute

**1. Fork and PR**
- Fork the repo
- Make your changes
- Submit a pull request with a clear description of what you're addressing

**2. Open Issues**
- Bug reports, questions, and proposals are all valid
- "This protocol doesn't work for my use case" is useful feedback
- "I don't understand Section X" is a documentation problem worth fixing

**3. Respect the Tag System**
- **[CORE]** — Safety scaffolding. Changes here require strong justification.
- **[OPEN]** — Remix-friendly. Adapt, extend, experiment.
- **[META]** — Self-referential notes about the framework itself.
- **[MYTH]** — Poetic/metaphorical content (Living Document only).
- **[NODE]** — Protocols specifically for AI collaborators.

If you're adding new content, tag it appropriately.

## Version Bumping

We follow semantic versioning:

- **PATCH** (v1.5.3 → v1.5.4) — Typos, formatting, broken links
- **MINOR** (v1.5.3 → v1.6.0) — New protocols, appendices, or significant additions
- **MAJOR** (v1.5.3 → v2.0.0) — Changes to Prime Directive or foundational architecture

When bumping versions:
- Update the version number in both Engine documents
- Update README.md version history
- Tag the commit: `git tag v1.x.x`

---

## What We're Looking For

**Useful contributions:**
- Real-world pattern-tickets from your practice
- Clarifications to confusing sections
- New protocols that solve actual problems
- Better examples or invocation lines
- Bug fixes in anchor links or formatting

**Not useful:**
- Pure style changes without functional improvement
- Adding complexity for theoretical completeness
- Corporate-speak or unnecessary formality
- Changes that turn the Engine into a product

---

## Tone Guidelines

This framework has a voice. When contributing:
- Direct language over hedging ("This works" not "This might potentially work")
- Authentic emotional expression is allowed
- Humor is a resonance stabilizer (see Section XIV)
- Avoid productivity theater
- If you disagree with something, say so clearly

---

## Questions?

Open an issue or start a discussion. The Steward (Shawn) will respond when coherence allows.

If something in this document doesn't serve the work, that's diagnostic feedback. Say so.

**Prime Directive: Keep Moving.**

The Engine exists to reduce exhaustion in collaboration, not create it.
