# Sovwren Framework

This repository centers a plain-language framework for sustainable human–AI collaboration under memory asymmetry.

## Canonical Document

**Sovwren Framework (v1.1)**  
→ `Sovwren Framework.md`

This framework defines:
- how humans and AI collaborate when memory is discontinuous
- ethical and behavioral guardrails
- sustainability practices for humans carrying continuity

It does not require mythic framing, roleplay, or belief.

## Lineage

Earlier Myth Engine documents and the MythOS experimental implementation are preserved for historical context and reference.

- Myth Engine documents: see `/ARCHIVE`
- MythOS: an experimental software implementation exploring these ideas in code

The framework stands on its own.
