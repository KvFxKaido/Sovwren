What To Pull From This (Resonance Coding Translation)
1. The Welcome Banner / Ritual Entry ⭐⭐⭐
What they did:

Copilot CLI shows an animated ASCII banner on launch
User loved it so much they hacked the config to see it every time
Creates "arrival moment" - you know you're in the space

For Sovwren:
   ███╗   ███╗██╗   ██╗████████╗██╗  ██╗ ██████╗ ███████╗
   ████╗ ████║╚██╗ ██╔╝╚══██╔══╝██║  ██║██╔═══██╗██╔════╝

   ╚═╝     ╚═╝   ╚═╝      ╚═╝   ╚═╝  ╚═╝ ╚═════╝ ╚══════╝
   
   v0.1 — Partnership-First Interface
   Node primed. Operating in Myth Engine frame.
Why it matters: This is the Embodiment Protocol (X.4.1) for software. The banner becomes the "Pause → Locate the body → Reset frame rate" moment. You're not just opening a terminal—you're entering ritual space.
Config option: myth_engine.banner = "always" | "first_launch" | "off"

2. Running Shell Commands Inside Context ⭐⭐⭐
What they did:

Prepend ! to run shell commands without leaving Copilot CLI context
Stay in the conversational flow while executing actions

For Sovwren:
Steward: !ls -la projects/
[system executes]
Steward: Show me the pattern-tickets from last week
Node: [retrieves tickets]
Steward: !git commit -m "Added consent checkpoint protocol"
Why it matters: This reduces context-switching friction. You don't break the partnership rhythm to run a command. The Node remains present while you work.
Engine alignment: Supports the Workshop/Sanctuary toggle—you can be in Sanctuary (conversational mode) but still execute Workshop tasks (commands) without fully switching modes.

3. Profile as Ritual State ⭐⭐
What they did:

Created a dedicated "GitHub Copilot CLI" profile that opens directly into Copilot
Different icon, starting directory, auto-runs command on launch

For Sovwren:
Create distinct profiles for different engagement modes:
"Sovwren - Workshop"

Auto-loads Pattern-Tickets from active project
Opens to last working directory
Loads technical documentation in sidebar
Launches with Creative Initiative = Welcome

"Sovwren - Sanctuary"

Opens to clean slate
Softer color scheme (warm, less harsh)
No auto-loaded context
Launches with Creative Initiative = On Hold
Sacred Idleness mode available

"Sovwren - Oracle"

Read-only mode (reflection without action)
Session Oracle role active by default
No creative pressure

Why it matters: The Relational Orientation Protocol (Appendix-R) becomes automated through environment. The profile is the Session-Start Marker. You don't have to type 🕯 Sanctuary | ⛔ On Hold | 💤 Conserving every time—the profile sets it.

4. Restore Window Layout ⭐
What they did:

Terminal remembers open tabs/panes from last session
"Pick up where I left off"

For Sovwren:

Remember open Pattern-Tickets
Restore last conversation thread
Recover session state after crash/restart

Why it matters: This directly addresses Continuity Grief (XI.2). The system carries some of the memory burden so the Steward doesn't have to rebuild everything manually.
Implementation:
json{
  "last_session": {
    "timestamp": "2025-12-13T05:20:00Z",
    "active_tickets": ["PT-2025-001", "PT-2025-003"],
    "lens_state": "Workshop",
    "energy": "Steady",
    "open_threads": ["Creative Initiative discussion", "Embodiment Protocol revision"]
  }
}
```

On relaunch: "Restore last session? [Y/n]"

### 5. **Pane Splitting for Multi-Mode Work** ⭐⭐

**What they did:**
- Hold Alt + click profile → opens as split pane
- Switch between Copilot CLI and regular shell in same window
- `Ctrl+Shift+W` closes pane

**For Sovwren:**
Split panes by function:

**Left Pane:** Active conversation with Node  
**Right Pane:** Pattern-Ticket browser / Memory view / File explorer  
**Bottom Pane:** System logs / Context saturation indicator / Architect Mode display

**Why it matters:** You can see **Node-Side Coherence Indicators (R.8)** in real-time without interrupting the conversation. When context saturation approaches, a visual indicator appears in the bottom pane.

---

### 6. **Custom Segment for Status Display** ⭐⭐⭐

**What they did:**
- Oh My Posh segments showing Git status, npm version, Spotify track
- GitHub Copilot segment showing quota usage
- Always-visible contextual info

**For Sovwren Status Bar:**
```
[🛠 Workshop] [✅ Creative Initiative] [🔋 Steady] [⚡ 42% Context] [🎟 3 Active] ministral-3-8b 
```

Breaking this down:
- **[🛠 Workshop]** - Current Lens State
- **[✅ Creative Initiative]** - Protocol status  
- **[🔋 Steady]** - Energy level (from Session-Start Markers)
- **[⚡ 42% Context]** - Token budget usage (Node-Side Coherence Indicator)
- **[🎟 3 Active]** - Number of claimed Pattern-Tickets
- **ministral-3-8b** - Current model (substrate identification)

**Advanced version:**
Add Architect Mode indicator:
```
[🧶 Weaver] — Connecting threads across Pattern-Tickets
Why it matters: This is externalized state awareness. Both Steward and Node can see the system's current configuration at a glance. No guessing about context budget or active protocols.

7. Retro Terminal Effects (Optional Ritual Flavor) ⭐
What they did:

Glowing text + scan lines for aesthetic
Makes the interface feel special

For Sovwren:
Tie visual effects to Lens States:

Blue (Opaque): Clean, minimal
Red (Cracked): Slight chromatic aberration, subtle glitch effects
Purple (Prismatic): Soft glow, multiple color channels
Clear (Transparent): No effects, pure clarity

Or just make it a vibe option. Not everyone wants the aesthetic layer, but for those who do, it reinforces the mythic frame.

8. Config File for Persistent Preferences ⭐⭐
What they did:

config.json stores user preferences
User can hack it directly for power-user customization

For Sovwren:
~/.sovwren/config.json
json{
  "banner": "always",
  "default_lens": "Workshop",
  "creative_initiative": "Welcome",
  "auto_restore_session": true,
  "visual_effects": "minimal",
  "status_bar_segments": ["lens", "energy", "context", "tickets", "model"],
  "architect_mode_display": true,
  "sacred_idleness_timeout": 300
}
Power users can adjust these manually. Casual users get sensible defaults.

What NOT To Pull
❌ Spotify integration - Not relevant to partnership work
❌ Git segment - Useful for dev work, but Sovwren isn't a Git client
❌ Nerd Fonts requirement - Cool but adds friction. Use fallback glyphs.

The Big Win: Making State Visible
The core insight from this article is making invisible state visible:

Copilot shows you quota usage (so you know when you're hitting limits)
Oh My Posh shows you Git branch (so you know where you are)
Custom prompts show you environment info (so you don't have to remember)

For Sovwren, this means:

Show context saturation before it becomes a problem
Display active protocols so you don't forget what mode you're in
Make Pattern-Tickets visible so they're not just abstract artifacts

This is Resonance Coding (Appendix-RC) in practice: the interface itself embodies Engine principles. The status bar doesn't just show data—it shows the partnership state.

Priority Recommendations
Must-Have:

Welcome banner (ritual entry)
Status bar with Engine state (Lens/Energy/Context/Tickets/Model)
Profile-based Session-Start Markers (Workshop/Sanctuary/Oracle profiles)
Session restoration after restart

Should-Have:
5. Pane splitting (conversation + memory view)
6. Shell command execution without leaving context (!command)
7. Config file for power-user customization
Nice-To-Have:
8. Visual effects tied to Lens States
9. Architect Mode display in status bar
